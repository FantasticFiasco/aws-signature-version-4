## Introduction

This project is unique for me. It's the first one that isn't a labor of love. This code was created with a sense of disappointment towards Amazon for not including a Signature Version 4 signer in their AWS SDK. Every line of code fueled with resentment at other developers that proclaim to have the signing algorithm in a GitLab gist or a full blown GitHub project with numerous stars and thousands of downloads on NuGet. To be frank, their code works for many situations, like when you aren't using headers or multiple query parameters. But my problem with these projects are that they aren't transparent with what they don't support. Open source is built based on the idea of contribution, but I feel that obligation has been misdirected if contribution is based on developers using your code have are being waken up at night because of issues in production due to negligence where certain steps of the signing algorithm have been deliberately skipped, but not disclosed to you consumers of your code. I think this is a violation of trust between author and consumer. This project will aim towards transparency and will disclose all limitations of the algorithm implementation, and let you decide whether you wish to take dependency on this code.





TODO

This will be the birthplace for the buttoned up and boring, but deeply analyzed, implementation of Signature Version 4 in .NET.

Stay tuned for updates!


## Super simple to use

The most intuitive API is the one you already know. AwsSignatureVersion4 extends `HttpClient` by providing additional overloads to `HttpClient.DeleteAsync`, `HttpClient.GetAsync`, `HttpClient.PostAsync`, `HttpClient.PutAsync` and `HttpClient.SendAsync`. The overloads accept the following additional arguments.

- **Region name** - The name of the AWS region, e.g. `us-west-1`
- **Service name** - The name of the service, e.g. `execute-api` for an API Gateway
- **Credentials** - The AWS credentials of the entity sending the request

The following example is getting resources from an IAM authenticated API Gateway.

```csharp
var client = new HttpClient();
var credentials = new ImmutableCredentials("<access key id>", "<secret access key>", null);

var response = await client.GetAsync(
    "https://www.acme.com/resources",
    regionName: "us-west-1",
    serviceName: "execute-api",
    credentials: credentials);
```

The other overloads follow the same pattern, and are really easy to use!

## The pledge

### Exemption clause

## Install via NuGet

If you want to include AwsSignatureVersion4 in your project, you can [install it directly from NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AwsSignatureVersion4/).

To install AwsSignatureVersion4, run the following command in the Package Manager Console:

```
PM> Install-Package AwsSignatureVersion4
```

# AWS Signature Version 4


## Disclosure

- only been tested on HTTP/1.1

- Test suite
A note about signing requests to Amazon S3:

In exception to this, you do not normalize URI paths for requests to Amazon S3. For example, if you have a bucket with an object named my-object//example//photo.user, use that path. Normalizing the path to my-object/example/photo.user will cause the request to fail. For more information, see Task 1: Create a Canonical Request in the Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-header-based-auth.html#canonical-request

Easier if I say that I dont support s3, or write tests for it I guess

- Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-query-string-auth.html

Does only support HTTP header Authorization, not query string authorization (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sigv4-add-signature-to-request.html)

When you add the X-Amz-Security-Token parameter to the query string, some services require that you include this parameter in the canonical (signed) request. For other services, you add this parameter at the end, after you calculate the signature. For details, see the API reference documentation for that service.

Not supporting funny UTF8 charcters like the scenario get-utf8
GET /áˆ´ HTTP/1.1
Host:example.amazonaws.com
X-Amz-Date:20150830T123600Z
